assests

components: startupCard, navbar, searchformreset, searchform

added shadcn/ui
added sanity

adding schema in sanity/schematypes
then config in index.ts and structure.ts

create author and startup on /studio
then we will fetch data now

wrote query for startup, query.tsx
use live content API of sanity, to get content in real-time without refreshing

make search work:
fetc query from searchformreset, then use it in searchform to filter startups

ppr applied: views getting updated
now, sanity write operation to update views

write-client for views update, fetch in views.tsx but it'll return us a skeleton, to avoid tht use "unstable_after"
Basically, update the infow ithout blocking the UI 

couldn't use unstable_after, so i did "user server-only" and updated views accordingly

author authentication: made new query in queries.ts
then to auth.ts, add callback there if the authenticated user is author
created session, if user exist then fine or else create an author

create startup form:
StartupForm.tsx
Used MDEditor lib

new hook for form action: useActionState

Form Validation: Zod

Code break info: Sentry
